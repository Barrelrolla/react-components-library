# Dark Mode Toggle

There are two variants: `selector` and `toggle`. Both requre a DarkModeContext. The context is included in the ThemeProvider, but can also be used separately. Just wrap your app inside it.

## Selector

<img src='../../../images/DarkModeToggle/DarkModeSelector.png' style='max-height:40px'/>  
<br></br>

The selector is a 3 way button that allows selecting dark, light or system mode.

## Toggle

<img src='../../../images/DarkModeToggle/DarkModeToggle.png' style='max-height:30px'/>
<br></br>

The toggle switches between dark and light mode.
